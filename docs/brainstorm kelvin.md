I imagine Dandilion will be a combination of Dandy, Cardinal Quest and Ultima.

I would hope that it's complexity will be constrained to allow for a flowing multiplayer experience

It will essentially be a dungeon based fighting/exploration game

#### While the above three games sugest a dungeons and dragons type theme based in the middle ages, it would be nice for the game to perhaps be placed in a more modern, futuristic or off world context.

Below are listed features of the three games to inspire thought on the features we want to include

### Dandy

- Is real time
- Is multiplayer
- Attacks are primarily ranged
- Monsters (3 levels)
- Monsters degrade to a lower level on hit
- Monsters cannot pass over other objects
- Contact with a monster results in both a hit for the monster and the player
- Monsters all have equal attack
- Monster generators (3 levels)
- Generators degrade to a lower level on hit
- Health is gained by picking up health (object)
- Players can be resurrected by shooting hearts
- If no players are dead shooting hearts spawns a monster
- Money (object) can be picked up and contributes to score but cannot be spent
- Levels are a set size (100x100)
- Each level has an entrance and an exit
- Doors are opened by keys (object)
- Bombs (object) can be picked up and detonated by a player
- Bombs when detonated hit all monsters on screen at once
- Bombs can also be detonated by shooting

### Cardinal Quest

- Is turn based (time is based on player moves)
- Is single player
- Has multiple character types
 - Fighter, Wizard, Ranger, Pugilist, Cleric, Theif and Alchemist
- Characters have attributes
 - Level, health, attack, defense, intelligence, faith, speed, stealth, magic resist
- Charactes can start the game with special abilities that change the way the player gains experience
- Charactes can wear armour, one item of jewelery and weild one weapon
 - head gear, breast plate, footwear, gloves or braciers, broach or necklace or ring
- Items found can either be equipped or trashed for coin
- Coin can also be found
- Items are either found in chests or are discarded when an enemy is killed
- Attributes can be increased by raising level or reading books (object)
- Attacks are primarily melee
- Ranged attacks or spells are location specific (player selects location for attack or cast)
- Attacks are chance based
- Attacks are variable in strength based on weapon used
- Players can carry up to 5 items (or pairs of items)
    - Examples: health potion, bazerk, scroll (multiple types), sleep powder, blinding powder, invisibility potion
- Players can have up to 5 abilities
    - Examples: Fire spell, Sleep spell, bazerk, bless weapon, enchant, critical attack, shaddow walk, pistol, recruit
- Abilities can be exchanged (picked up, dropped, bought)
- Abilities recharge over time based on a player attribute
- Levels are always randomly generated
- Levels are variable in shape
- Levels have one exit
- The exit can be locked
- Levels with locked exits have bosses that when killed drop the key
- Levels can have doors which a player can open (once open cannot be closed)
- Non playing characters cannot open doors
- Two types of non-enemy non-playing characters: Trader and Peasant
- Traders can be hit and then become an enemy
- Peasants will not fight but can be killed for coin
- Many enemy types (at least 30)
    - Examples: Thug, Guard, Ogre, Wizard (4 types each with different spells), Spiders (4 types), Wolves

### Ultima

I'm not that familiar with Ultima but it is essentially what inspired the Elder Scrolls series (Obilivion and Skyrim etc)

The main points to compare with Dandy and Cardinal Quest are:

- Single Player
- Open world
- Different terrain
- Villages
- Shops
- Many non-enemy characters
