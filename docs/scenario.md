## Scenario

I think it's important to have a scenario. I would prefer a sci-fi setting. While I think that in time we could add procedural level generation, initially we should have a loose story - much like the original Doom. Doom had three episodes, each a series of levels. Each episode with an introduction and the levels all connected by a map that was expanded as the player moved through each level.

I favour the industrial colony scenario.

Off world industrial colony that has been overrun by aliens (bugs like Starship Troopers). The colony civil government has broken down and chaos exists. There are several factions controlled by various leaders. The levels are disused factories, living habitats, farming domes, energy generation facilities etc.

- Each level will have power that is either working or not.
- Each level can have:
  - Bug generators
  - Caches (chests)
  - doors that can be opened or closed either locally (at the door) or remotely
  - doors that need power and others that don't
  - circuit breakers that control some kind of electrical or mechanical device
  - conveyor belts
  - crushers
  - lights
  - bug repellers (like in halflife 2)
- Non-Playing Characters will differ between the different episodes
  - From the different factions
  - Not all will be hostile (unless attacked)
    - Traders
    - Mercenaries (can be recruited)
    - Spiders (don't roam freely but hold a certain area and defend it)
- The alien bugs are the common enemy
  - Most will attack all characters
  - Some will be 'pets' controlled by other characters
