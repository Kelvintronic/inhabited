When a level is started by the user the tile map layout will be supplied to the render engine by the core game model. This is to allow for auto map generation. Each tile on a map will have an integer identifier and these will be stored in an array or vector (linked list) structure. This will allow maps to be created in a simple paint program or text editor.
